# Gang Rescue Mod
This mod adds a functionality to [Bounty Hunting - Expanded and Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/1073?tab=files) by Shtivi.
To compile this mod you need my framework that, out of imagination and creativity, I called rdr2sdk. You can find it [here](https://github.com/stefax71/rdr2sdk) or, as an alternative, you can use the provided binary in the lib folder.

The code is provided "as-is". You are welcome to make pull requests if you enhance it.

Thanks to Ked, CruelMasterMC, Tuffy for sharing their code and giving hints!

## How to compile it

To compile the project you must download the [sdk](https://github.com/stefax71/rdr2sdk) and add it as a dependency to this project.
In case it does not resolve correctly the includes, maybe because the sdk is not in the same directory as this project, you must configure the Game directory of the sdk as an additional include directory in your project settings.

### Warning
The [Script Hook RDR 2 SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/) which is required to link the final .asi file must be downloaded separately.
