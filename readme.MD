### Gang Rescue Mod
This mod adds a functionality to [Bounty Hunting - Expanded and Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/1073?tab=files) by Shtivi.
To compile this mod you need my framework that, out of imagination and creativity, I called rdr2sdk. You can find it [here](https://github.com/stefax71/rdr2sdk) or, as an alternative, you can use the provided binary in the lib folder.

The code is provided "as-is". You are welcome to make pull requests if you enhance it.

Thanks to Ked, CruelMasterMC, Tuffy for sharing their code and giving hints!
